            I like to stay home and sleep. I'm a boring person and I think so myself, but most people tell me that saying that out loud isn't the way to go. I'm just here spitting facts. Anyway, as of 2018, I am a CVHS junior. This year is okay... I really don't get as much sleep as the last two years due to PHYSICS. I HATE PHYSICS. WHY DID I TAKE IT?! It's because I was foolish. Everyone has their weakest subject in school, and for me, it's physics. Aside from that, I'm part of the drumline for this school. Sounds cool, dosen't it? Well I attend practices Tuesdays, Wed, and Thursdays, (sometimes Saturdays) for about 3 hours. I honestly don't see a problem with it because I enjoy music, however, this does take up my time for physics studying. At home, I get bored easily. I can't really go anywhere since I'm busy, then so I just watch anime and/or play Fortnite. I always get sick, too, which sucks because I miss one day, that feels equivalent to missing a whole week of school. On the bright side, I have friends I talk to; they all like Marvel and cars. I do, too. That's all I gotta say for now. I'll probably keep this field updated now and then. CIAO!
